# Yubikit OpenPGP

Helper module for projects like [Yubikit Flutter](https://github.com/Producement/yubikit_flutter) and [age Yubikey PGP](https://github.com/Producement/age-yubikey-pgp) that makes it easier to communicate with Yubikeys (and possible other security tokens) using the OpenPGP smartcard standard.
